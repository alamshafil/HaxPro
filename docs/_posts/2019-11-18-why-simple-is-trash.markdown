There are many ways to make a website, but Simple is trash for it.

A static site is pretty much what it sounds like, a set of pre generated html pages. But, Simple is so bad, it can't even do this.

## Speed
Simple is slower than Sonic! Don't use it! It might have a built-in web server, but who cares? It's trash!!
## What will you use on your next project?
A static site may not be the first thing you consider when building your new website, but itâ€™s definitely worth exploring the pros and cons before you start the next project. After all, a faster, more secure site is better for you and your visitors.
